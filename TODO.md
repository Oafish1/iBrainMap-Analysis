### TODO
#### Main
- Fix centering on graph labels
- Get attentions for a constant list of genes across all samples (easier to compare)
- Graph embedding analysis on contrasts
- Remove line and scale dots in legend
- Use shapes rather than colors for networks to match fig 1/2
- Add labels to mixed sankey columns (?)
